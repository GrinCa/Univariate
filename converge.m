%this script is useful to test the convergence of the method. It uses the
%.geo file and change the size of the elements, in order to change the
%number of nodes.

% Note : this algorithm use version 3.0.6 of Gmsh and version 4.1 of
% FreeFem. The algorithm is likely to fail if the version of Gmsh is higher
% than 3.0.6

% both arrays stand for size of elastic and acoustic nodes respectively.
% For each colum of both arrays, the main script will be run. Therefore it
% is possible to put as much as values that we desire, but the size of each
% array must be the same. 
% NOTE : If the size of elastic and acoustic is different, the mesh
% elements won't be regular, which implies that the mean quadratic pressure
% is no longer a good indicator.
